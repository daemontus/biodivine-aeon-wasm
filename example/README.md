A simple usage example for `aeon-wasm`.

To use the example, you have to first build your local copy of `aeon-wasm` (i.e.
you should have a `pkg` directory in your repository).
For that, see the main README. 

Next, you can start a local sever in *the root* repository folder,
for example by running `python3 -m http.server 8008`. The examples should
then be accessible at http://localhost:8008/example.
